# fourk_raytraced_renderings
4k resolution renderings of irtc raytracing competition and other povray and bryce scenes

These are the 4k lossless versions of 4k uploads to @raytracedvibes on twitter since they get converted to jpg when posting.

Files are rendered in the best quality that they can be while matching close to the original. When possible, in the newest povray 3.8 with:

- Blue Channel Noise Dithering (+THBNX)
- Supersampling (+A0.0)
- AA Method 3 (+AM3)

Often we revert back to a linux build of pov 2.x for older scenes, those will get Supersampled only.
